    <h1 class="style3"> Community Profile: Fairfield</h1>
    <p align="justify">This was the first major assignment for the year and got us to network with people in the community. I completed this study in April 2009.  </p>
    <p align="justify"><img src="images/DSCF1693.JPG" width="248" height="184" align="left" />The Fairfield community is made up of 1000 households and has a  population of over 2000 people. Fairfield is located in the area nestled  between Sunnyvale, Saddle Hill and the Dunedin Southern motorway bypass. The  information was provided by  interviews with local people and council officials,  information from Statistics New Zealand, QV  New Zealand, previous studies on the area and information available on the  internet.</p>
    <p align="justify"><img src="images/DSCF1691.JPG" width="248" height="184" align="right" />I identified the Skater Culture and the Music Culture as two major cultures in the area. Because of the high socio-economic nature of the area, altruism and time were two of the major needs that presented itself in the study. <a href="images/Fairfield Community Profile.doc">DOWNLOAD HERE</a>. This study was conducted in an area where there was no intentional youth contact and one of the possible outcomes was a position working in the area next year.</p>
    <p align="justify">I learnt a lot in the process of doing the profile. I learnt how to initiate meetings with council workers and gained experience in asking good questions. I learnt how to present my findings effectively and propose a project for the future. I gained valuable credibility with the school and other key community contacts which made getting access to the school easy. </p>
    <p align="justify">I also learnt that before jumping head first into a new project after identifying goals, it is important to stop and ask a few questions like: &quot;is this where Jesus wants me to be?&quot;. I pushed hard for a Fairfield initiative with my agency but once I stopped to think about it I realised that my heart was not for that area. I did not feel God was calling me to minister to the affluent and rich, but rather the poor in the community next door. This ended up with me learning a great lesson in patience and humility. I had  to tell my agency that I had approached with such energy and passion in the first place that I had jumped the gun and really felt that God was not calling me to that mission field. Honesty and reason meant the agency took it well, however I do not feel my efforts in the profile were wasted because they can be used for other projects or as a basis for funding if someone else feels called to Fairfield.</p>

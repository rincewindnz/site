    <h1>Working for Saddle Hill Foundation Trust</h1>
    <p align="justify">Working for a Trust was a new experience for me. My previous employment had always been in a company setting, so having the comparatively slack oversight from management was something to get used to.</p>
    <p align="justify"><img src="images/saddlehill.jpg" width="248" height="184" align="left" />Working for a Trust was very frustrating at  times. There were many things that could make youth work more effective, such  as having more time to connect and follow up with young people after programs. But  because these kinds of things are not very easy to quantify for funding  applications it falls on your own time rather than time that SHFT can fund. Any  new initiatives or ministries take a long time to initialise. If that ministry is needed immediately or will only be effective for a short period of time, the delay in funding could result in needs being missed. I have noticed that other ministries have become stagnant  or in need of rethinking because the programs are run because they have always  been run.</p>
    <p align="justify">I have also noticed that because the governing  arm is one step removed from the youth work they have to take their lead from  our manager. In some ways they can only hear and see what is going on second or  third hand which means decisions they make are largely based on how effective the youth workers are in reporting back to the Trust. One positive aspect of the Trust is that they ask really good, hard questions from an objective viewpoint. This means that when we want to start something new we have to clearly identify the need and the way it is going to be run. This is a great way to make sure that someone is holding us accountable to our work.</p>
    <p align="justify"><img src="images/Hub interior.jpg" width="200" height="160" align="right" />At  another level it enabled me as a youth worker to easily gain access to schools  and community resources because SHFT has been working effectively for a long  time. I could basically walk up to the principal of Fairfield School, mention I  was a youth worker with SHFT and I instantly got the whole school's support and  free reign within the school. They were begging me to run activities at lunchtimes. This  means youth work can be very effective because there is already a rapport with  the local community.</p>
        <h2>Gaps in Service provision</h2>
        <p align="justify">I have worked hard this year to find gaps in the services provided by SHFT because there was the possibility of  getting some work from them when I finished my internship.There were two major gaps I found this year: in Fairfield and the 17+ age group. Next year there will be a gap in service with the 11-13 year olds. I also noticed some issues with how the services were being provided.</p>
        <h3>Fairfield</h3>
        <p align="justify">My community profile identified major gaps in the service provided in Fairfield. You can read about them in my <a href="images/Fairfield Community Profile.doc">community profile</a>, they included: providing a youth worker to connect with the school and a program in the community on a Saturday night for young people to go to. I pulled back from pioneering this because I felt it was not where I was meant to be, as explained <a href="Community Profile.html">here</a>.</p>
        <h3>Ages 17+</h3>
        <p align="justify">Our agency is losing this age group from our youth programs either to programs in other communities up to 14 kilometers away or to no program at all. We have almost no young people in this age group from the local school connecting with us in any way during the week. Talking to the Youth Aid Officer this is a real need that needs to be addressed because it is these young people on Friday and Saturday nights with no connections to the community making work for her.</p>
        <h3>Ages 11-14</h3>
        <p align="justify">This year my Dynamyte program has filled this need and it has grown in size from an average of 15 people a week in the first term to around 25 a week by the end of the year. In fact if they lose this program and the committed youth worker running it next year they are going to have to address this need again.</p>
        <h3>Other Gaps</h3>
        <p align="justify">One of the reasons we are finding it hard to get funding and also why we are losing young people from programs is because we do not have an effective evaluation process in place. If we established an evalutaion process we could see what young people are learning (if anything), what impact our services are making in these young people's lives and from parents to see if there has been a change in how the young people are living their lives. We can see how effective we are in our goals as well as being able to show potential funders what we do.</p>
        <h2>Possible Projects</h2>
        <p align="justify">From those gaps identified there are several projects that could be established next year:</p>
        <p align="justify">A Friday or Saturday night program in Fairfield backed up by a chaplain.</p>
        <p align="justify">An expansion of my 18+ bible study to be more inclusive of community kids in the 17+ age bracket.</p>
        <p align="justify">An intentional 11-14 year old group.</p>
        <p align="justify">Better information gathering in the Mosgiel area for needs and connections with other agencies.</p>

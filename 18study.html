    <h1 class="style3"> 18+ Study Group</h1>
    <p align="justify"><img src="images/study1.jpg" width="248" height="184" align="right" />I started the study group this year out of a clear need identified by one of the older members of our youth group. We have an issue with the older 17 year olds dropping out of the youth group because they tend to move over the hill for work or University. I started this group because eight of the people in this age group were committed to staying at church for the year and needed a place to hang but also do some more in-depth bible studies.</p>
    <p align="justify"><img src="images/study2.JPG" width="248" height="184" align="left" />We started the year with a Passover dinner as it was the week leading up to Easter  when we got started. We decided that we would meet every Tuesday night for dinner and a bible study. This has worked well because many people in the group have holidays at different times and some are working.</p>
    <p align="justify">We set out to have a biblical worldview and started with Genesis  looking at what God intended for us,  what went wrong and how this has impacted the world story so far. We have also looked at theodicy in Job and our most favourite segment has been Dave Andrews' bible study Plan Be, looking at social justice.</p>
    <p align="justify">The studies were easy enough to plan and prepare and the dinner has worked well as a youth-group style hang out with some intention to it. Unfortunately the group is made up of friends that have grown up together through the church and next year we will look to make it less of a clique. One way we will try and do this is by  having a study every second week and doing other things that people can freely bring friends along to every other week. This group has also fulfilled a need that I have  to engage academically with texts and having people closer my age that I can journey with. I have only felt like a facilitator rather than a leader of this group which has been liberating and look to share the facilitation around next year.</p>

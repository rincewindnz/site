    <p align="justify">I asked teachers, my agency boss, parents and some of the young people I connect with for some feedback on my work this year. I asked those people to choose a few of the areas mentioned in the grid to the right and comment on areas I needed to grow in as well as commenting on areas that I do well. </p>
    <p align="justify">Some of the results were a surprise to me. It's hard as a Kiwi to take compliments and actually acknowledge what I do well. It is easier to find and talk about weaknessess. </p>
    <p align="justify">The four main areas that were identified from the feedback were: </p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Inclusive/Warmth</strong>; <strong>Adaptability</strong>; <strong>Genuineness/Honesty; Punctual and Reliable</strong>; <strong>Patience</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <h3>Inclusive/Warmth</h3>
    <p align="justify">As you can read in some of the feedback many of those that have attended our home group have found that I have a warmth for all people and I am inclusive of all types of people no matter who they are. I have enjoyed getting to know people this year and strive to make them feel at home in whatever context I might be in. Interestingly the parents have found that my warmth is appropriate and genuine enough to make young people comfortable without being cheesy.</p>
    <h3>Adaptability</h3>
    <p align="justify">This has been a key aspect of reaching needs that young people have and something that I have learnt doing ABLs and dealing with different age groups. It is cool to see that both adults, who view the programs from a distance, and young people within the program notice how the program is fluid rather than rigid. I find the way I can adapt to different age groups is by being myself and bringing the young people or old people up to my level, rather than trying to patronise them in how I interact with them.</p>
    <h3>Genuineness and Honesty</h3>
    <p align="justify">I'm not too sure what I can say about this area, except this has been a growth area for me. It is hard to just accept who you are and be who you are around other people especially when you have been bullied in the past for being true to yourself. I have noticed that young people will just see right through any hats you try and put on when working with them. My honesty and genuineness has gotten me in trouble as well. One person commented that &quot;you don't mess people about and you are very straight to the point&quot;. This has got me in trouble with various people who I have been genuine and honest with but in a way that has been unhelpful. In doing so I have sometimes cut people off, or made them think that I have not listened to their point of view on certain topics.</p>
    <h3>Punctual and Reliable</h3>
    <p align="justify">This has been a way of being a good role model to those in the community that do not see all the work I do with young people. It is also a way to promote the agency I work for and help maintain its good name so that future youth workers can benefit from the same reputation. Being reliable is also part of the game with young people, being reliable means that you respect and honour the young people you are connecting with. Not being reliable says to a young person that you do not think they are as important as they are.</p>
    <h3>Patience</h3>
    <p align="justify">I found it interesting that many of the young people from Dynamyte have picked up on this as a strength. I would personally have put this in a weakness and an area that needs growth. Although I am very patient with young people (I can only think of two occasions this year where I have either blown up and had to leave the room). I have a very short temper when it comes to issues I am passionate about and dealing with adult and workmates that I think should know better.</p>
    <h2>Weaknesses and Areas of Development</h2>
    <h3>Humility</h3>
    <p align="justify">I found it interesting that this came up in the constructive criticism. Although some had mentioned that I own up to my mistakes and have developed a good sense of humility in my role as &quot;just an intern&quot;, someone mentioned that it was a bad thing. They said that sometimes it comes across too strong and it almost seems like I do not back myself. This has been an issue that keeps arising, it is not so much to do with humility as self-confidence.</p>
    <p align="justify">I often take criticism harshly and will jump to criticise myself before other people can criticise me. This could mean that I am finding issues where there are not any issues, it could also mean that where my leadership needs confidence I am not showing the needed confidence.</p>
    <h3>Expression of Ideas</h3>
    <p align="justify">The criticism I use on myself I also apply to everything. This is not in and of itself a bad thing. Discernment is a key aspect of who I am and I will always test new ideas before accepting or discarding them. This means that I think deeply about many issues. Because I have usually spent a lot of time thinking about issues I get impatient and frustrated with others that have not spent the same time thinking about those issues. I will often express my ideas in an unhelpful polemic way. This lesson has come at a price with some people thinking that I would be unsuitable for a position of leadership because of the poor way that I have expressed ideas in a team setting.</p>
    <h3>Patience</h3>
    <p align="justify">Because of the way I express ideas and the haste that I like to approach new challenges means that my patience is an area that needs some development. Rather than getting frustrated in situations I need to find a better way of taking time over issues and picking my battles and what is actually important a little smarter.</p>
    <h3>Organisation of Games</h3>
    <p>I really think I could have made a bit more of an effort to play some organised games at Fairfield School, but this came down to only being given one hour a week to hang out there and didn't feature high in my preparation time priorities. Sorry guys!</p>
    <h3>Mathematics:</h3> 
    <p>I think I've commented on about eight different areas now...</p>

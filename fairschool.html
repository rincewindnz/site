    <h1 class="style3"> Fairfield School</h1>
    <p align="justify"><img src="images/DSCF1696.JPG" width="248" height="184" align="right" />Fairfield School visits have been a small part of my role this year. Prior to my <a href="Community Profile.html">Community Profile</a> I had never been into a school since I left six years ago. I regularily visited Fairfield School on Friday lunchtimes. </p>
    <p align="justify">My first visit (after a meeting with the Principal and Deputy Principal) consisted of  going through the classes and introducing myself. Then on Friday lunchtime I took the Earthball and ran some games with the young people. Over the next three terms I caught up with the Year 8 teacher and formed a strong network with the school.</p>
    <img src="images/DSCF1695.JPG" width="248" height="184" align="left" />
    <p align="justify">I enjoyed visiting the school and found that it was enough to just turn up on Friday lunchtimes and play the odd game of ball tag. I found that after a term of hanging out many of the young people, especially the boys, would come over and share all sorts of things about their week with me.</p>
    <p align="justify">Over my time at the school the teachers allowed me to do Evaluations For Transformation (EFT) with members of the class and they also recommended a student for me to mentor over the year. I learnt how just being myself around young people can be very effective. I didn't have to organise any activities or games, all I had to do was be available. </p>
    <p align="justify">The highlight of the visits was during the EFT two young people shared some stories about how they were experiencing bullying at school and in the community. I was able to share some of my experiences with bullying with the young people and then as they left one of the them turned back and said, &quot;it's been really good to be able to talk about this stuff&quot; and then went back to class.</p>
